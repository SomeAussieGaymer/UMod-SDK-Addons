# UMod SDK Addons

Addons are modular enhancements for Unity and the UMod SDK.  
They can be used **standalone** or as part of the **UMod SDK V2 addon system**.

This repo includes both official and community addons.

## ✨ Available Addons

- **Tabs**  
  Browser-like tabs for Unity: drag-and-drop creation, smooth scrolling, quick add menu, shortcuts, and integration with other Editor Enhancers.  

- **Folders**  
  Keep projects organised with custom folder icons, colours, navigation, minimaps, and smart shortcuts — all lightweight and intuitive.  

- **Hierarchy**  
  Streamline your hierarchy with icons, colours, scene switching, bookmarks, component minimaps, activation toggles, and handy shortcuts.

> Currently these folders contain test files only. The full addons will be released with the SDK V2 update.
